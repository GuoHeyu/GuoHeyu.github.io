My academic advisor is Professor [Yasaman Ghasempour](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/yasaman-ghasempour). My research interest lies in wireless communication, the Internet of Things (IoT). My detailed CV can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/GuoHeyu/GuoHeyu.github.io/blob/main/files/CV.pdf).

Before joining Princeton, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in July 2023. I was in [the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/), majoring in EE(IC Design).
